# mkt-615: Data Storytelling for Marketers

### Course Description
Research and writing papers usually take a long time and it is common to have a paper going through a review process for 2-4 years. Implementing a good and efficient workflow doesnâ€™t only make research easier and efficient, but it is essential when working on multiple projects with multiple co-authors for several years. In this class, we will cover practical tools and skills that will benefit your research and future career. We will cover topics like version control and project management, data collection, storage, cleaning, and visualization using tools such as GitHub, R and RStudio, and MySQL.
