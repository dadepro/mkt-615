# Course: Data Storytelling for Marketing

I will teach the first seven weeks (then Dinesh will take over)

--

All the material is available at https://github.com/dadepro/mkt-615

We are going to use Git and GitHub to download course material and upload homeworks, assigments, and presentations

--

What will we learn?

- We will focus on practical skill and tools that will benfit your research process
  1. Project management
  2. Version control (Git and GitHub)
  3. Accessing computing resources at USC (Shell)
  3. Data manipulation, cleaning, visualization (R)
  4. Data storage (MySQL)

--

> *"In short, we will cover things that I wish someone had taught me when I was starting out in graduate
school."*

--

Please bring your laptops to class. This will be a very hands-on course. We'll be working through lecture notes together in class and you'll be running code on your own laptops

# Why R and SQL?

```{R, indeeddotcom, echo = F, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 9, dev = "svg"}
# The popularity data
pop_df = 
  data.frame(
  lang = c("SQL", "Python", "R", "SAS", "Matlab", "SPSS", "Stata"),
  n_jobs = c(107130, 66976, 48772, 25644, 11464, 3717, 1624),
  free = c(T, T, T, F, F, F, F)
  )
## Plot it
pop_df %>% 
  mutate(lang = lang %>% factor(ordered = T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lang, y = n_jobs, fill = free)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  aes(x = reorder(lang, -n_jobs), fill = reorder(free, -free)) +
  xlab("") +
  scale_y_continuous(label = scales::comma) +
  ylab("Number of jobs\n") +
  labs(
    title = "Comparing statistical languages",
    subtitle = "Number of job postings on Indeed.com, 2019/01/06"
    ) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    "Free?",
    labels = c("True", "False"),
    values = c("deepskyblue4", "Grey")
    ) +
  ggthemes::theme_pander(base_size = 17) +
  # theme_ipsum() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

# Why R and SQL? (cont.)

### R
- Along with Python, R has become the standard language for data science
- Open-source (free!)
- R has all the statistics and econometrics packages that you'll ever need 

### MySQl
- Manages large amount of data
- Data manipulation
- Quick access to data
- Fundamental skill for every data scientist

# Grading (first half only)

| Component                           | Weight |
|:-|-:|
| 2 × homework assignments (25% each) | 50% |
| 1 × project 		| 40% |
| 1 x short presentation | 10% |

The project involves the analysis of a dataset of your choice using the tools we learned in class
- You will present your data analysis on **October 6**
- Where can I find datasets? 
  - [Google dataset search engine](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
  - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)
  - All Marketing Science papers come with replication code and data
  - You can scrape it yourself (advanced, we won't have time to cover scraping)
  - Me (Airbnb, Yelp, Expedia)

- Short presentation of a R package/tool related to the lectures (I will provide a list among which to choose)

---

# Grading (first half only, cont.)

Other points:
- You will be submitting all of your assignments as R Markdown documents.
- My lecture slides and notes are all written in R Markdown too. (E.g. This slide deck is built using the [**xaringan**](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki))

### R and Rstudio
Download the latest version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

Installing useful packages:
```{r eval=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
# Package names
packages <- c("sjmisc", "RMySQL", "stargazer", "fixest", "ggthemes" , "zoo", "data.table", "lfe", "ggplot2", "readxl", "dplyr", "tidyr", "ggfortify", 
              "DT", "reshape2", "knitr", "lubridate", "pwr", "psy", "car", "doBy", "imputeMissings", "RcmdrMisc", "questionr", 
              "vcd", "multcomp", "KappaGUI", "rcompanion", "FactoMineR", "factoextra", "corrplot", "ltm", "goeveg", "corrplot",

if (any(installed_packages == FALSE)) {
  install.packages(packages[!installed_packages])
}

### MySQL Client

**Mac:** [Sequel Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/)

**Windows:** [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)

---

# Setting up your laptops for the class (cont.)

### Git and GitHub

Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (Windows users might also need [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) so that they have a Bash shell)

Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account

Let me know if you need help, one place to start is https://happygitwithr.com/

# Setting up your laptops for the class (cont.)

### Some OS-specific extras

- **Windows:** Install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

- **Mac:** Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). I also recommend that you configure/open your C++ toolchain (see [here](https://github.com/rmacoslib/r-macos-rtools#installer-package-for-macos-r-toolchain-).)

- **Linux:** None (you should be good to go).

# Checklist

1. Do you have the most recent version of R and Rstudio?
  - Check R version from RStudio: 
      ```{r eval=FALSE}
      version$version.string
    ```
  - Check RStudio version: 
      ```{r eval=FALSE}
        RStudio.Version()$version
        #Requires an interactive session but should return something like "[1] 1.4.1106"
      ```
  
2. Update all R Packages: 
      ```{r eval=FALSE}
      update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)
      ```
      
---

# Checklist (cont.)

Open the Bash [Shell](https://happygitwithr.com/shell.html#shell)
- Check Git version: `git --version`
  
- Configure Git information using the Shell (substitute in your details):
  ```{r eval=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
  git config --global user.name 'Davide Proserpio'
  git config --global user.email 'proserpi@marshall.usc.edu'
  git config --global --list
  ```
  
  or 
  
  `git config --global --edit` and use [vim](https://www.vim.org/) to modify the file

- Did you create a GitHub account?

- Recently GitHub updated its security requirements and now uses 2FA. This means that to access Git via Shell you need a token
  - Create a [GitHub access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
  - **Save it somewhere**, you'll need it to authenticate using the Shell (some help [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68775869/support-for-password-authentication-was-removed-please-use-a-personal-access-to))

# Research Workflow

### Organization is key for several reasons
1. Research projects last a long time

--

2. Collaboration with co-authors

--

3. Replicability 

<!-- -- -->

<!-- ### What we are going to learn in this class will help you improve your research workflow -->

# Research Workflow (cont.)

<div align="center">
<img src="http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif" height=400>
<br>
<br>
(A version control software such as Git helps a lot with this issue)
</div>

---

# Research Workflow (cont.)

### How I keep things organized
- Example of a project folder: 
<div align="center">
<img src="01-intro-files/figures/folders.png" height=200>
</div>

- Plus version control software (SVN or Git) that allows me to both track versions and changes (Dropbox does not track changes!)
---

# Research Workflow (cont.)

Once I submit to a journal, I create a README file clearly describing each script and what it produces
- this is extremely important and will help you creating the replication files that many journals ask for

# Research Worklfow (cont.)

### Software/tools

- R, Rstudio: Preliminary analysis, plotting
- MySQL: Where I store all my datasets
- Python: "Advanced" analysis/data manipulation
- Latex: Write papers
- Slack (drastically reduces emails)

### Text Editor
- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
  - Can be used for everything, from Latex to R
  - Connects directly to a server so you can work on "remote" files

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) also very good!

### Useful resources

I collected (and updating) a bunch of [resources](https://dadepro.github.io/resources.html) that can be useful for grad school and academic life
